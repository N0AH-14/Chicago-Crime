## Overview
The objective of this project is to build a scalable and modular pipeline using Python for:
- Data Ingestion: Efficient extraction of a large CSV dataset in manageable chunks.
- Data Transformation: Cleaning, normalization, and type conversion of raw data.
- Data Storage: Loading processed data into a MySQL or MongoDB database with proper indexing.
- Machine Learning: Applying basic classification (e.g., predicting arrest outcomes), clustering (identifying crime hotspots), and regression (forecasting yearly crime counts) algorithms.
- Visualization: Generating summary statistics and plots for integration with a PowerBI dashboard.
This solution is designed to support data-driven decision-making for public safety and urban management initiatives.

## Dataset & License
- **Dataset:** Crime Data from 2020 to Present (https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/about_data)
  This dataset provides detailed records of crimes in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present.
- **Dataset License:**
  The dataset is released under the **CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication**. This means the data is free for public use without restrictions.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/los-angeles-crime-data-analytics.git
   cd los-angeles-crime-data-analytics
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Dependencies include: pandas, sqlalchemy, pymysql, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.*
4. **Configure the project:**
   - Update `config.py` with your database credentials and paths.
   - Ensure your database (MySQL or MongoDB) is running and accessible.

## Usage
1. **Dataset Placement:**  
   Place the downloaded CSV file from the Los Angeles dataset into the `data/` directory and rename it (if necessary) to `crime_data.csv`.
2. **Run the Pipeline:**  
   Execute the main script to start the ETL process, run machine learning models, and generate visual outputs:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Monitor Logs:**  
   Check the `logs/project.log` file for detailed logging information and error messages.
4. **Dashboard Integration:**  
   Processed output files (e.g., summary CSVs and plots) in `data/processed/` can be imported into PowerBI for interactive visualization.

## Machine Learning Models
- **Classification:**  
  Predicts the likelihood of an arrest using features such as year, location coordinates, and other attributes.
- **Clustering:**  
  Uses clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans) to identify and segment crime hotspots.
- **Regression:**  
  Forecasts crime counts over time (e.g., per year) using regression models such as RandomForestRegressor.
Each model is implemented in `model.py` with appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, MSE, silhouette score).
---
## Visualization
The `visualization.py` module generates:
- **Summary Statistics:**  
  CSV files containing descriptive statistics.
- **Trend Plots:**  
  Graphs (e.g., line charts) visualizing crime trends over time.
- **Clustered Data Export:**  
  CSV exports of clustered records for geospatial analysis.
These outputs are intended for use in PowerBI to create interactive dashboards.
---
## Future Enhancements
- **Scalability:**  
  Adapt the ETL pipeline for distributed processing using frameworks like Apache Spark.
- **Real-Time Analytics:**  
  Integrate streaming data sources for near real-time analysis.
- **Advanced Analytics:**  
  Incorporate deep learning models for anomaly detection and more sophisticated predictions.
- **Cloud Deployment:**  
  Explore containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalable, cloud-based deployment.
- **Enhanced Dashboarding:**  
  Integrate additional visualization tools for richer interactivity and geospatial mapping.
